### I am slow thinker 

I'm an AI researcher (I am researching... ㅎㅎ)
I am a white hacker who loves hacking. I ranked second overall in Dreamhack before, the largest existing hacking community in Korea (slow thinker). 
I love meditation thinking and Googling.
I am interested in intelligent catharsis and helping many people with hacking.
